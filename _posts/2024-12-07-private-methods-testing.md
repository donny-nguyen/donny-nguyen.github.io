# Private Methods Testing

Testing private methods in Java requires specific techniques since they're not directly accessible from test classes. Let me explain the main approaches and best practices.

The primary recommended approach is to test private methods indirectly through public methods that use them. This maintains proper encapsulation and tests the actual usage of the private methods in our code. When we test the public methods thoroughly, we inherently test the private methods they depend on.

However, if we need to test private methods directly for specific reasons, here are the main techniques:

Using Reflection:
```java
public class TestPrivateMethods {
    @Test
    public void testPrivateMethod() throws Exception {
        MyClass instanceToTest = new MyClass();
        
        Method privateMethod = MyClass.class.getDeclaredMethod("privateMethod", String.class);
        privateMethod.setAccessible(true);
        
        String result = (String) privateMethod.invoke(instanceToTest, "testInput");
        assertEquals("expectedOutput", result);
    }
}
```

Using Package-Private Access:
```java
// In production code
class MyClass {
    void methodToTest() {  // package-private instead of private
        // implementation
    }
}

// In test code (same package)
public class MyClassTest {
    @Test
    public void testMethod() {
        MyClass instance = new MyClass();
        instance.methodToTest();  // Direct access within same package
    }
}
```

However, if we find yourself frequently needing to test private methods, this often indicates potential design issues:

1. The class might be doing too much and could benefit from being split into smaller classes.
2. The private method might contain complex logic that should be moved to a separate class.
3. The method might actually deserve to be public or protected if it represents a discrete piece of functionality.

Consider this refactoring example:

```java
// Before
public class OrderProcessor {
    private boolean validateOrderDetails(Order order) {
        // Complex validation logic
    }
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        if (validateOrderDetails(order)) {
            // Process the order
        }
    }
}

// After
public class OrderValidator {
    public boolean validateOrderDetails(Order order) {
        // Complex validation logic
    }
}

public class OrderProcessor {
    private OrderValidator validator = new OrderValidator();
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        if (validator.validateOrderDetails(order)) {
            // Process the order
        }
    }
}
```

This refactored version improves testability while maintaining clean architecture principles.
