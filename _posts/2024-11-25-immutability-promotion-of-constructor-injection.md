# Immutability Promotion of Constructor Injection

Constructor injection promotes immutability by ensuring that all dependencies of an object are set at the time of its creation. Here's how:

1. **Final Fields:** When using constructor injection, it's common practice to declare the dependency fields as `final`. This means that once the object is constructed, the values of these fields cannot be changed.

2. **Immutable Objects:** If the dependencies themselves are immutable, and the object itself doesn't expose any methods to modify its internal state, the entire object becomes immutable. This prevents unintended side effects and makes the code more predictable.

3. **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe, as multiple threads can access them without the risk of data corruption. This is because there's no way to modify the object's state after it's created.

Here's an example of constructor injection promoting immutability:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1;
    private final Dependency2 dependency2;

    public MyClass(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
        this.dependency2 = dependency2;
    }

    // ... other methods that use dependency1 and dependency2
}
```

In this example, `dependency1` and `dependency2` are injected through the constructor and declared as `final`. Once the `MyClass` object is created, its dependencies cannot be changed, making it immutable.

By using constructor injection and declaring dependencies as `final`, we can create more robust, predictable, and thread-safe applications.
