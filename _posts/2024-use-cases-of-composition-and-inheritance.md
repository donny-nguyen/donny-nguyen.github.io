# Use Cases of Composition and Inheritance

**Use Cases of Composition**

* **Reusability:** When you want to reuse existing functionality within a new class, composition is ideal. For example, a `Car` class can be composed of an `Engine` class, a `SteeringWheel` class, and a `Transmission` class.
* **Flexibility:** Composition provides more flexibility than inheritance. You can easily swap out components at runtime, leading to more adaptable and maintainable code. For instance, a `Car` can have different `Engine` implementations based on the user's preference.
* **Avoiding Tight Coupling:** Composition helps to keep classes loosely coupled. Changes to a component class have minimal impact on the class that uses it, as long as the interface remains the same.

**Use Cases of Inheritance**

* **Specialization:** When you want to create a specialized version of an existing class, inheritance is appropriate. For example, a `Dog` class can inherit from an `Animal` class, inheriting general animal behaviors while adding specific dog behaviors.
* **Code Reusability:** Inheritance allows you to reuse code from a parent class in its child classes. This can save time and effort, especially when dealing with common functionalities.
* **Polymorphism:** Inheritance enables polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common parent class. This is crucial for designing flexible and extensible systems.

**Which is Used More Frequently Today?**

**Composition is generally preferred over inheritance in modern software development.** This is because it often leads to more flexible, maintainable, and testable code. Inheritance can introduce tight coupling and make it difficult to change the behavior of a class without affecting its subclasses.

**Key Considerations**

* **"Is-a" vs. "Has-a" Relationships:**
    * Inheritance is typically used when you have an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a `Dog` is an `Animal`).
    * Composition is used when you have a "has-a" relationship (e.g., a `Car` has an `Engine`).
* **Flexibility and Maintainability:** Composition often provides greater flexibility and is easier to maintain, especially in complex systems.

By carefully considering the relationships between classes and the desired level of flexibility, you can choose the most appropriate approach (composition or inheritance) for your specific design needs.
