# Measure Performance of Adonis.js Application

To measure the performance of an Adonis.js application, use a combination of built-in health checks, monitoring tools, request logging, and third-party analytics integrations for a comprehensive view of your appâ€™s efficiency and reliability.

## Built-in Health Checks

Adonis.js provides a robust health check system to monitor the application's environment and operational metrics:
- **Memory Usage**: Use `MemoryRSSCheck` and `MemoryHeapCheck` to watch memory utilization and define custom thresholds for warnings and failures.
- **Database Connectivity**: Add `DbCheck` to monitor SQL database connections for latency and failures.
- **Disk Space**: Use `DiskSpaceCheck` for monitoring available disk space and caching check results to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Register these checks in your health system and expose them through a `/health` endpoint for real-time status.

## Performance and Request Analytics

- **Request Logging & Monitoring**: Integrate tools like Apitally to track real-time API metrics, including request volume, response times, error rates, and endpoint-specific analytics.
- **Response Time Measurement**: Measure latency on each route and identify bottlenecks using custom middleware or analytics platforms.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for performance anomalies such as high error rates, slow endpoints, or application downtime.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze request patterns to see when and where performance issues or spikes occur.

## Optimization and Benchmarking

- **Benchmarking**: Use external benchmarking tools (e.g., Artillery, ApacheBench) to stress-test endpoints and document throughput and latency under load.
- **Profiling**: Employ Node.js profilers to analyze CPU and memory consumption during high-traffic scenarios.
- **Query Optimization**: Optimize database interactions using Adonis.js query builder to reduce unnecessary load and achieve faster response times.

## Summary Table

| Measurement Area            | Adonis.js Built-in       | External Options        | Example Metrics             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Memory & Resource Usage     | Health Checks            | Node.js profilers      | RSS, Heap, CPU, Disk |
| API Performance & Traffic   | Apitally Integration     | Datadog, Prometheus    | Requests/sec, Latency|
| Error Tracking              | Custom/Error Middleware  | Sentry, Apitally       | Error rate, Endpoint errors |
| Benchmarking                | Manual, Scripts          | Artillery, k6          | RPS, Latency under load|

Using these tools and techniques, performance measurement in Adonis.js can be both granular and actionable, allowing for rapid troubleshooting and ongoing optimization.
