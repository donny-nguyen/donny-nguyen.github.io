# Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where we write tests before writing the actual code. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test for a new feature or functionality. This test will initially fail because the feature hasn't been implemented yet.
2. **Run the Test**: Execute the test to confirm that it fails. This step ensures that the test is valid and that the feature is not already present.
3. **Write Code**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
4. **Run the Test Again**: Execute the test again to see if it passes with the new code.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring that the test still passes. This step improves code quality without changing its behavior.
6. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature or functionality.

The main benefits of TDD include:
- **Improved Code Quality**: By writing tests first, we ensure that our code meets the requirements and is less prone to bugs.
- **Simplified Debugging**: Since tests are written for small units of code, it's easier to identify and fix issues.
- **Better Design**: TDD encourages developers to think about the design and requirements before writing code, leading to more modular and maintainable code.
