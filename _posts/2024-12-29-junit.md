# JUnit

**JUnit** is a popular open-source testing framework for Java that is widely used for writing and running unit tests. It provides annotations, assertions, and test runners to help developers test individual components of their applications in isolation. JUnit promotes the concept of **test-driven development (TDD)**, encouraging developers to write tests before writing the actual code.

### Key Features of JUnit:
1. **Annotations**: Simplify test definition and setup. Examples include:
   - `@Test`: Marks a method as a test case.
   - `@BeforeEach`: Runs before each test, for setup.
   - `@AfterEach`: Runs after each test, for cleanup.
   - `@BeforeAll`: Runs once before all tests in a class, typically for global setup.
   - `@AfterAll`: Runs once after all tests in a class, typically for global cleanup.
   
2. **Assertions**: Methods that verify expected outcomes, such as:
   - `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Checks equality.
   - `assertTrue(condition)`: Verifies a condition is true.
   - `assertFalse(condition)`: Verifies a condition is false.
   - `assertNull(object)`: Checks if an object is `null`.
   - `assertNotNull(object)`: Ensures an object is not `null`.
   - `assertThrows(expectedException, executable)`: Verifies an exception is thrown.

3. **Parameterized Testing**: Allows testing multiple sets of inputs and expected outputs using a single test case.

4. **Integration with Build Tools**: Works seamlessly with tools like Maven, Gradle, and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.

5. **Test Runners**: Built-in runners execute tests and report results. JUnit also supports custom runners for specialized needs.

### Advantages of JUnit:
- **Encourages Modular Code**: By focusing on individual units of code, JUnit helps ensure that each module is independently testable and robust.
- **Automation Support**: Integrates with IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and CI/CD tools for automated test execution.
- **Extensible**: Can be combined with other frameworks like Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
- **Fast Feedback Loop**: Helps identify bugs early in the development lifecycle.

### Example JUnit Test:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    void testAddition() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.add(2, 3);
        assertEquals(5, result, "Addition should return the correct sum");
    }

    @Test
    void testDivisionByZero() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
            calculator.divide(10, 0);
        }, "Division by zero should throw ArithmeticException");
    }
}
```

### Common Use Cases:
- Testing business logic methods in isolation.
- Validating edge cases and error conditions.
- Ensuring regressions are prevented by running tests after code changes.
- Supporting TDD to improve software design and quality.

JUnit is a cornerstone for Java development testing and continues to evolve, with the latest versions (JUnit 5, also known as Jupiter) offering more flexibility and features compared to earlier versions.
