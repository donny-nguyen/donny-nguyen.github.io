# Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing** is a model of delivering computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the Internet ("the cloud"). Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, we can access technology services as needed from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**Key benefits of cloud computing include:**

* **Cost-effectiveness:** Pay only for the resources we use, reducing upfront costs and overhead.
* **Scalability:** Easily adjust our resources to meet changing demands, whether we need more or less.
* **Flexibility:** Access computing resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
* **Reliability:** Benefit from redundant infrastructure and disaster recovery capabilities.
* **Innovation:** Focus on developing our business, not managing IT infrastructure.

**Common types of cloud services include:**

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides fundamental building blocks like servers, storage, and networking.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a development environment for building and deploying applications.
* **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers applications over the internet, such as email, CRM, and ERP software.

**Examples of popular cloud providers include:**

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
