# Global Objects

Node.js provides several global objects that are accessible across the runtime without needing to import any modules. Here are some key ones with examples and descriptions:

1. **`global`**: This is the global object in Node.js, similar to `window` in a browser. Variables attached to `global` are accessible everywhere in the application.
   ```javascript
   global.myVar = "Hello, World!";
   console.log(global.myVar); // Output: Hello, World!
   ```
   - **Use**: It allows access to variables across files, though it is generally discouraged for maintaining clean code.

2. **`process`**: This object provides information about and control over the current Node.js process. It includes methods and properties that allow interaction with the operating system.
   ```javascript
   console.log(process.version); // Output: Node.js version
   console.log(process.argv); // Output: Array of command-line arguments
   ```
   - **Use**: Used for accessing environment variables, controlling the runtime, and exiting the process gracefully.

3. **`__dirname`**: A string that represents the directory name of the current module.
   ```javascript
   console.log(__dirname); // Output: Path to the current directory
   ```
   - **Use**: Useful for constructing absolute paths for files within the project.

4. **`__filename`**: Similar to `__dirname`, but it represents the absolute path to the current module file.
   ```javascript
   console.log(__filename); // Output: Path to the current file
   ```
   - **Use**: Handy for logging the current script's path and accessing the file.

5. **`module`** and **`exports`**: In Node.js, each file is treated as a module. The `module` object represents the current module, and `exports` is an object that modules use to export functions or data.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     sayHello: function () {
       return "Hello!";
     },
   };
   ```
   - **Use**: Allows modularization by defining which objects or functions are accessible outside of the file.

6. **`Buffer`**: A global object in Node.js that allows handling of binary data directly.
   ```javascript
   const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello, World!");
   console.log(buffer.toString()); // Output: Hello, World!
   ```
   - **Use**: Primarily for working with raw binary data, often in streams and file handling.

7. **`setTimeout`**, **`clearTimeout`**, **`setInterval`**, **`clearInterval`**: These are timer functions similar to those in the browser, but they work at the Node.js server level.
   ```javascript
   const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
     console.log("This will run after 1 second.");
   }, 1000);

   clearTimeout(timerId); // Prevents the timer from executing
   ```
   - **Use**: Useful for scheduling operations like delays or repeated tasks on the server.

Each of these global objects offers unique functionality thatâ€™s crucial for working within Node.js, from managing environment settings to handling binary data and scheduling.
