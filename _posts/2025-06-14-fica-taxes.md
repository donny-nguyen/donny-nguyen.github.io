# Social Security & Medicare Taxes (FICA Taxes)

In the U.S., **Social Security** and **Medicare taxes** (collectively called **FICA taxes**, or **Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes**) are payroll taxes that fund federal benefits programs. They are automatically withheld from your paycheck.

### **1. Social Security Tax**  
- **Rate**: **6.2%** (employee) + **6.2%** (employer) = **12.4% total**.  
- **Wage Limit (2024)**: **$168,600** (only income up to this amount is taxed).  
- **Purpose**: Funds retirement, disability, and survivor benefits.  

---

### **2. Medicare Tax**  
- **Rate**: **1.45%** (employee) + **1.45%** (employer) = **2.9% total**.  
- **No wage limit** (all earned income is taxed).  
- **Additional Medicare Tax (for high earners)**:  
  - **0.9% extra** on wages above:  
    - **$200,000** (Single)  
    - **$250,000** (Married Filing Jointly)

### **Who Pays FICA Taxes?**  
- **Employees**: Split with employer (7.65% total: 6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare).  
- **Self-Employed**: Pay the full **15.3%** (called **Self-Employment Tax**, covers both halves).  
- **Exemptions**:  
  - **F-1/J-1 students** (first **5 years**) are **exempt** from Social Security & Medicare taxes.  
  - **H-1B, L-1, and other work visa holders** must pay FICA taxes.

### **How It Works in Your Paycheck**  
- If you earn **$60,000/year**:  
  - **Social Security**: $60,000 × 6.2% = **$3,720** (you pay) + $3,720 (employer pays).  
  - **Medicare**: $60,000 × 1.45% = **$870** (you pay) + $870 (employer pays).  
- **Total FICA deduction**: **$4,590/year** from your salary.

### **Key Differences from Income Tax**  
| Feature          | FICA Taxes | Federal Income Tax |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Withheld From** | Paycheck  | Paycheck           |
| **Rate**         | Fixed %    | Progressive (10%-37%) |
| **Wage Limit**   | Yes (Social Security) | No (all income taxed) |
| **Purpose**      | Funds Social Security/Medicare | General U.S. budget |

### **What If Too Much Was Withheld?**  
- If you’re **exempt** (e.g., F-1 student) but your employer withheld FICA:  
  - Request a **refund** using **Form 843**.  
- If you **overpaid** Social Security (e.g., switched jobs and exceeded $168,600):  
  - Claim a **credit** on your tax return.

### **Why It Matters**  
- These taxes fund critical safety-net programs.  
- **H-1B workers**: Pay into Social Security, making them eligible for future benefits (if they work 10+ years).  
- **F-1 OPT students**: Should confirm they’re **not** wrongly charged FICA in their first 5 years.  

**Tax Tip**: Check your **pay stubs** to ensure correct FICA withholding!
