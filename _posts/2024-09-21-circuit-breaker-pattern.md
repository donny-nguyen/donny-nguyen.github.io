# Circuit Breaker Pattern

The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is a design pattern used in distributed systems to handle potential failures in a resilient way. It prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping the flow of requests to a service when it is likely to fail, and allows the system to recover gracefully. This pattern is commonly used in microservice architectures to maintain system stability and ensure fault tolerance.

### How It Works:
The circuit breaker acts like an electrical circuit breaker. When a service call fails repeatedly, the circuit "opens," blocking further attempts to contact the failing service. Over time, the circuit "half-opens," allowing a few requests to pass through to test if the service has recovered. If the service responds successfully, the circuit "closes" and normal traffic resumes.

### States in Circuit Breaker Pattern:
1. **Closed**: 
   - The service is functioning normally.
   - All requests are allowed to pass through to the service.
   - If a certain threshold of failures is reached, the circuit breaker transitions to the "Open" state.

2. **Open**: 
   - The service has encountered repeated failures.
   - Requests are blocked from reaching the service, and an error or fallback is immediately returned.
   - The circuit breaker stays open for a predefined period (cool-down period).

3. **Half-Open**: 
   - After the cool-down period, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests to pass through to check if the service has recovered.
   - If the service responses are successful, the circuit breaker transitions back to "Closed."
   - If failures continue, the circuit goes back to "Open."

### Benefits:
- **Failure Isolation**: By cutting off requests to a failing service, the system prevents cascading failures and ensures the failure does not spread to other parts of the application.
  
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system can return a fallback response, cached data, or a default message instead of waiting for a slow or failing service.

- **Improved Latency**: Since failing requests are blocked and immediately responded to with an error, the overall system performance can improve by avoiding long wait times.

- **Self-Healing**: The half-open state enables the system to automatically recover once the service becomes healthy, without requiring manual intervention.

### Common Scenarios:
- **Network Issues**: In distributed systems, network problems between services can cause delays or failures. The circuit breaker prevents repeated attempts to reach an unresponsive service.
  
- **High Latency**: When a service starts responding too slowly due to load, the circuit breaker can prevent the entire system from becoming bogged down.

- **Temporary Downtime**: If a service is undergoing maintenance or experiencing temporary issues, the circuit breaker can stop requests until the service is restored.

### Example:
Consider an e-commerce application where a payment service becomes unavailable. Without a circuit breaker, the checkout process might keep trying to contact the payment service, leading to slow response times and frustrated users. With a circuit breaker, once a certain number of failed payment attempts are detected, the circuit opens, and further requests are blocked. The user might receive a message like "Payment service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later," and the system can recover once the service is back online.

- **Resilience4j** (a popular library for Java)
- **Istio** (service mesh for Kubernetes)
