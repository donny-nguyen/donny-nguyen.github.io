# Spring Boot

**Spring Boot** is a powerful extension of the Spring framework designed to simplify the development of production-ready applications. Here are some key features:

1. **Autoconfiguration**: Spring Boot automatically configures our application based on the dependencies we have added, reducing the need for manual setup¹.

2. **Standalone Applications**: It allows us to create standalone applications that can run independently without requiring an external web server. This is achieved by embedding servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow².

3. **Opinionated Defaults**: Spring Boot provides a set of default configurations and dependencies, known as "starters," to streamline the development process².

4. **Production-Ready Features**: It includes built-in features for monitoring, health checks, and externalized configuration, making it easier to manage applications in production³.

5. **Spring Initializr**: A web-based tool that helps us quickly bootstrap a new Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies⁴.

Spring Boot is particularly useful for creating microservices and web applications due to its ease of use and minimal configuration requirements.
