# Substantial Presence Test (SPT) – Explained Simply
The **Substantial Presence Test (SPT)** is a rule used by the IRS to determine if a foreign national (like an H-1B, F-1, or J-1 visa holder) qualifies as a **U.S. tax resident** (and must pay taxes like a citizen).  

---

### **How It Works**  
You meet the **SPT** (and become a **resident alien for tax purposes**) if you were physically present in the U.S. for:  
1. **At least 31 days** in the **current year**, **AND**  
2. **183+ days** over **3 years** (current year + 2 prior years), calculated as:  
   - **All days** in the current year, **+**  
   - **1/3 of days** from the previous year, **+**  
   - **1/6 of days** from the year before that.  

#### **Example Calculation (2024 Tax Year)**  

| Year       | Days Present | Weighted Days |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **2024**   | 180 days     | 180 (full)    |
| **2023**   | 120 days     | 40 (120 ÷ 3)  |
| **2022**   | 60 days      | 10 (60 ÷ 6)   |
| **Total**  | –            | **230 days**  |  

✅ **Result**: You pass the SPT (230 > 183) and are a **tax resident** for 2024.

### **Who Is Exempt?**  
Some visa holders **don’t count days** toward the SPT, including:  
- **F-1/J-1 students** (exempt for **first 5 calendar years**).  
- **J-1 scholars/teachers** (exempt for **2 out of last 6 years**).  
- **Diplomats** (exempt indefinitely).  

⚠️ **Important**: Even if exempt, you **must file Form 8843** to prove your status.  

---

### **Why It Matters**  
- **Tax Resident (SPT passed)**: Pay taxes on **worldwide income** (like a U.S. citizen). File **Form 1040**.  
- **Nonresident (SPT failed)**: Pay taxes only on **U.S. income** (e.g., wages). File **Form 1040-NR**.  

#### **Common Scenarios**  

| Visa       | First Years | Later Years |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **F-1 OPT** | Nonresident (exempt) | Resident (if SPT passed after 5 years) |
| **H-1B**   | Resident (usually passes SPT Year 1) | Resident |
| **J-1**    | Depends on category (often exempt) | Resident if SPT passed |

---

### **What If You Pass the SPT Mid-Year?**  
You may be a **dual-status alien** (part-year resident + part-year nonresident). In this case:  
- File **both 1040 and 1040-NR** (or a combined return).  
- Only income earned **after becoming a resident** is taxed globally.

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. The SPT decides if you’re a **U.S. tax resident**.  
2. **F-1/J-1 students** are usually exempt early on but must track their 5-year limit.  
3. **H-1B workers** almost always become residents in their **first year**.  
4. **File Form 8843** if exempt to avoid errors.
