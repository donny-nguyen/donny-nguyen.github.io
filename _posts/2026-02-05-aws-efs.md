# Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

**Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is AWS’s fully managed, serverless, elastic file storage that automatically scales to petabytes and supports simultaneous access from thousands of compute resources.** It’s ideal when you need shared, POSIX‑compliant storage across EC2, containers, or Lambda without managing any storage servers.

## What Amazon EFS Is
- **Serverless, fully managed NFS file system** — no provisioning, patching, or capacity planning.   
- **Elastic scaling** — grows and shrinks automatically as files are added or removed.   
- **Shared access** — supports thousands of EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions concurrently via NFSv4.0/4.1.   
- **Multi‑AZ availability** — data is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones for durability and uptime.   

---

## How EFS Works
- You create a **file system** in a region.  
- It is automatically distributed across multiple AZs.  
- You mount it on EC2 or other compute resources using **NFSv4.1** and the **EFS mount helper**.  
- Once mounted, you read/write files just like a standard Linux file system.

## Key Features
### 🔹 Elastic & Serverless
- No capacity planning; scales to petabytes.  
- Automatically adjusts performance as your workload changes.

### 🔹 High Availability & Durability
- Multi‑AZ replication ensures resilience. 

### 🔹 Performance Modes
- **General Purpose** — low latency, ideal for web apps, CMS, dev environments.  
- **Max I/O** — higher throughput for big data, analytics, and large-scale workloads.

### 🔹 Storage Classes
- **Standard** — frequently accessed data.  
- **Infrequent Access (IA)** — lower cost for data accessed less often.

### 🔹 Security
- Supports **encryption at rest and in transit**, IAM authorization, and VPC security controls.

## Common Use Cases
- **Web servers & CMS** needing shared file storage.  
- **Container workloads** (ECS, EKS) requiring persistent volumes.  
- **Machine learning pipelines** sharing datasets.  
- **CI/CD systems** storing build artifacts.  
- **Lift‑and‑shift applications** that expect POSIX file systems.

## EFS vs. S3 vs. EBS (Quick Comparison)

| Feature | EFS | S3 | EBS |
|--------|-----|----|-----|
| Type | Network file system (NFS) | Object storage | Block storage |
| Access | Many instances at once | Global access via API | Single EC2 instance (or multi‑attach for some types) |
| Use Case | Shared POSIX file system | Backups, static assets, big data | Databases, OS disks |
| Scaling | Automatic | Automatic | Must provision size |

## Why You Might Choose EFS
If you need **shared, POSIX‑compliant storage** that behaves like a traditional file system but without managing servers or capacity, EFS is the simplest and most scalable option in AWS.
