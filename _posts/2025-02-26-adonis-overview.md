# Adonis.js Overview

Adonis.js is a Node.js web framework that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It is designed to make server-side web development more efficient by providing a structured, opinionated environment with built-in solutions for common web development challenges.

## Key Features

Adonis.js offers a comprehensive set of features that distinguish it from other Node.js frameworks:

**Full-stack framework**: Unlike Express.js which is minimalist, Adonis.js provides solutions for routing, authentication, database operations, and more out of the box.

**Strong TypeScript support**: Adonis.js version 5+ is built with TypeScript, offering strong typing and better developer experience.

**ORM system**: Lucid ORM allows developers to interact with databases using an elegant, active record implementation.

**Authentication**: Built-in authentication systems including session-based, JWT, and API tokens.

**Middleware system**: For handling HTTP requests and implementing cross-cutting concerns.

**CLI tool**: Adonis CLI helps with scaffolding projects, generating files, and running migrations.

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

Adonis.js is often compared to Laravel (PHP) and Rails (Ruby) due to its similar full-featured approach and convention-over-configuration philosophy. Unlike Express.js or Koa.js which require additional libraries for many features, Adonis.js aims to be more integrated and complete.

## When to Use Adonis.js

Adonis.js is particularly well-suited for:
- Medium to large web applications where productivity and structure are important
- Projects where you need robust built-in solutions for common requirements
- Teams familiar with Laravel or similar frameworks who want to use Node.js
