# Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)

An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a nine-digit tax processing number issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who need to file taxes but aren't eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN). ITINs are used for federal tax purposes only and don't provide work authorization, immigration status, or eligibility for Social Security benefits.

### Key Features of ITIN:

* **Issued by:** Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* **Format:** 9-digit number starting with "9" (XXX-XX-XXXX)
* **Purpose:** Tax filing and reporting purposes
* **Eligibility:** Individuals not eligible for SSN, including non-resident aliens, dependents, spouses of U.S. citizens or residents, and undocumented immigrants

### What ITIN Can Be Used For:

* **Filing tax returns:** ITIN holders can file federal tax returns and claim certain tax credits and deductions.
* **Opening bank accounts:** Some financial institutions accept ITINs as identification for opening bank accounts.
* **Establishing credit history:** ITIN holders may be able to establish credit history by applying for loans or credit cards with certain financial institutions.
* **Business purposes:** ITINs can be used for business-related activities, such as obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or filing business taxes.

### Important Notes:

ITINs don't expire if used to file a federal tax return at least once every three years.
ITIN holders may be eligible for certain tax benefits, such as the Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents.
ITINs are not a form of identification outside the federal tax system.
