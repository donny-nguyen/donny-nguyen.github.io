# Java EE (Jakarta EE)

Java EE, now called Jakarta EE,  is a collection of specifications for building enterprise applications. These applications are typically large, complex, and mission-critical for businesses.  Java EE provides a set of standards and tools that make it easier to develop these applications.

Here's a breakdown of what Java EE offers:

* **Specifications:** These define how different parts of an application should work together. This ensures that applications built with Java EE are portable and can run on different systems.
* **APIs:** These provide pre-written code for common tasks, such as connecting to databases or implementing security features. This saves developers time and effort.
* **Runtime environment:** This is the software that provides the foundation for running Java EE applications. It includes an application server, which manages the lifecycle of applications and provides essential services.

In short, Java EE provides a comprehensive platform for developing large-scale, reliable, and secure enterprise applications.
