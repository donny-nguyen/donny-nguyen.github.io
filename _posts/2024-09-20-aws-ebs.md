# AWS EBS

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)** is a scalable, high-performance block storage service designed to be used with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Here are some key features and benefits of Amazon EBS:

- **Multiple Volume Types**: Amazon EBS offers various volume types to optimize storage performance and cost for different applications. These include SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads.
- **Scalability**: We can create EBS volumes with specific capacity and performance requirements. We can also dynamically increase capacity or adjust performance without downtime.
- **Backup and Recovery**: EBS snapshots provide point-in-time backups of volumes, which can be used for disaster recovery, data migration, and compliance.
- **Data Protection**: EBS volumes and snapshots can be encrypted to ensure the security of data-at-rest and data-in-transit.
- **High Availability and Durability**: EBS volumes are designed for high availability and durability, with data automatically replicated across multiple servers within an Availability Zone.
