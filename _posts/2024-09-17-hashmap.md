# HashMap

In Java, a **HashMap** is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides an efficient way to store key-value pairs. It is part of the `java.util` package and implements the `Map` interface, which means it maps keys to values. Here are some key characteristics and features of a HashMap:

### 1. **Key-Value Pair Storage**

A `HashMap` stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique, but values can be duplicated. We can use keys to retrieve their corresponding values.

### 2. **Hashing**

HashMap uses a technique called **hashing** to store and retrieve elements efficiently. When a key is added to the map, it is hashed, and the resulting hash code determines the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored. This allows for average constant-time performance for `get()` and `put()` operations.

### 3. **No Ordering**

HashMap does not maintain any order of the keys or values. If we need to maintain the insertion order, we should use `LinkedHashMap`, and for sorting based on the keys, `TreeMap` is the right choice.

### 4. **Null Keys and Values**

HashMap allows one **null key** and multiple null values. However, having too many nulls might reduce the map's efficiency.

### 5. **Not Synchronized**

HashMap is **not thread-safe**. If we need a synchronized (thread-safe) version, we can use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` to wrap the HashMap or use `ConcurrentHashMap`.

### 6. **Performance**

The time complexity for basic operations like `get()` and `put()` is generally **O(1)**, assuming the hash function distributes keys evenly across the array. However, in the worst case (where all elements hash to the same bucket), it can degrade to **O(n)**.

### 7. **Internal Structure**

HashMap uses an internal array of buckets, where each bucket is a `LinkedList` or a `Tree` (since Java 8). If the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold, the bucket is transformed from a `LinkedList` to a `Tree` to improve search performance.

### 8. **Load Factor and Capacity**

`HashMap` has two key parameters:
  - **Initial Capacity**: The size of the internal table (bucket array) at the time of creation.
  - **Load Factor**: A measure of how full the map can get before it needs to resize its internal structure (rehashing). The default load factor is 0.75, meaning when 75% of the buckets are filled, the HashMap will double its size.

### Example Usage
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding elements to the map
        map.put("Apple", 10);
        map.put("Banana", 20);
        map.put("Orange", 30);

        // Retrieving a value by key
        System.out.println("Value for 'Apple': " + map.get("Apple"));

        // Checking if a key or value exists
        System.out.println("Contains 'Banana'?: " + map.containsKey("Banana"));

        // Iterating through the HashMap
        for (String key : map.keySet()) {
            System.out.println(key + ": " + map.get(key));
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Operations
- `put(K key, V value)`: Inserts or updates a key-value pair.
- `get(Object key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key.
- `remove(Object key)`: Removes the key-value pair for the specified key.
- `containsKey(Object key)`: Checks if a key is present in the map.
- `containsValue(Object value)`: Checks if a value is present in the map.
- `keySet()`: Returns a `Set` view of the keys.
- `values()`: Returns a `Collection` view of the values.

### When to Use HashMap
- We need fast access to data based on keys.
- The order of elements doesn't matter.
- We don't need a thread-safe collection.
