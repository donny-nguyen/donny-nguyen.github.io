# Collections

In Dart, Collections are data structures that store a group of related items. Dart provides several built-in collection types, including:

1. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items. Lists are the most commonly used collection type in Dart.

2. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items. Sets are useful when we want to store a collection of items without duplicates

3. **Maps**: Collections of key-value pairs. Maps are useful when we want to store and retrieve data using a unique key.

4. **Queues**: Ordered collections that support insertion at the rear and removal from the front. Queues are useful for implementing first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structures.

5. **Deques**: Double-ended queues that support insertion and removal at both the front and the rear.

Dart's collection types provide a wide range of methods and properties for manipulating and accessing the data they hold. For example, we can add, remove, and search for items in a List, or check the length of a Map. Collections in Dart are also strongly typed, meaning we can specify the type of elements the collection can hold.

Dart's collection types are versatile and provide a lot of functionality for managing and manipulating data. They are essential for building complex Dart applications.
