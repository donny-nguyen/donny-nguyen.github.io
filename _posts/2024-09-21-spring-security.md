# Spring Security

**Spring Security** is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications, primarily used in conjunction with the Spring framework. It provides comprehensive security services for Java applications, addressing various concerns related to authentication, authorization, and more. Here are some key features of Spring Security:

1. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users. It supports different methods, such as in-memory authentication, database-backed authentication, LDAP, OAuth2, and more.
   
2. **Authorization**: Determines whether a user is allowed to access a specific resource or perform an action based on their roles and permissions.
   
3. **Security Filters**: Uses a filter chain to intercept HTTP requests and apply security policies (e.g., login, logout, access control).
   
4. **CSRF Protection**: Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks by adding tokens to forms to ensure the request is valid.
   
5. **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, providing protection against session fixation and other session-related vulnerabilities.
   
6. **Password Management**: Handles secure password hashing and encoding using algorithms like BCrypt, PBKDF2, and SCrypt.
   
7. **Method-Level Security**: Provides the ability to secure methods using annotations like `@Secured`, `@PreAuthorize`, and `@PostAuthorize` to enforce security at the business logic level.

In our project (with Spring Boot and AWS), Spring Security could help secure our API by managing which users or services can interact with our application. For example, even if the game application doesn't require user login, Spring Security can enforce secure communication (e.g., API token-based access) between our game client and the server.
