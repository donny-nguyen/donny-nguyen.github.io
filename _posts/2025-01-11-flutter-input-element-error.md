# The Error "The targeted input element must be the active input element"

The error "The targeted input element must be the active input element" you're encountering is likely due to a known issue in Flutter 3.27.0. This problem specifically affects text input fields in Flutter web applications when debugging in Chrome.

The root cause of this issue is related to a recent change in the Flutter framework that affects how input elements are handled in web applications. It's not a problem with your code or environment specifically, but rather a bug in the current stable release of Flutter.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. Wait for a hotfix: The Flutter team is aware of this problem, and it's likely to be addressed in an upcoming patch release (e.g., 3.27.1).

2. Downgrade Flutter: You can temporarily downgrade to Flutter 3.24.5, which doesn't have this issue.

3. Use the master channel: The issue has reportedly been fixed in the master channel of Flutter, so you could switch to that if you're comfortable using a less stable version.

If you need an immediate solution and can't wait for the official fix, downgrading to Flutter 3.24.5 is probably the safest option for now.
