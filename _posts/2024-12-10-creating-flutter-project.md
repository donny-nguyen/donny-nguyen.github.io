# Creating a Flutter Project

Creating a Flutter project is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up and start a new project:

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Install Flutter SDK**:
   - Download the Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Add the `flutter` command to your system's PATH.
   - Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal to check for dependencies and fix any issues.

2. **Install an IDE**:
   - Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like **Visual Studio Code** or **Android Studio**.
   - Add Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions to your IDE.

3. **Set up a Device/Emulator**:
   - For testing, connect a physical device via USB or set up an emulator/simulator for Android or iOS.
