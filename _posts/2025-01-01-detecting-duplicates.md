# Detecting Duplicates

Detecting duplicates in SQL is a common task! Here's a straightforward way to do it. Assuming you have a table named `your_table` and you want to find duplicates based on a specific column, say `your_column`, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT your_column, COUNT(*)
FROM your_table
GROUP BY your_column
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This query groups the records by the column of interest (`your_column`) and then counts the number of occurrences of each value. The `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` condition filters the results to only include the values that appear more than once, i.e., the duplicates.

You can also extend this to check for duplicates based on multiple columns. For example, if you want to find duplicates based on a combination of `column1` and `column2`, you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
