# AWS Chime SDK

AWS Chime SDK is a set of real-time communications components that developers can use to add audio, video, and screen sharing capabilities to their own applications. Here's an overview:

## Key Features

**Core Capabilities:**
- Audio and video calling
- Screen sharing
- Messaging
- Meeting management
- PSTN (phone) audio integration

**Use Cases:**
- Virtual meetings and collaboration tools
- Telehealth applications
- Virtual classrooms and e-learning
- Customer service and support applications
- Live events and webinars

## Main Components

The SDK is broken into several components:

- **Client SDKs** - Available for JavaScript, iOS, and Android to build the client-side experience
- **Media services** - Handle the audio/video processing and mixing
- **Messaging** - Persistent messaging capabilities with webhooks
- **PSTN Audio** - Allows dial-in and dial-out to regular phone numbers
- **SIP integration** - Connect with existing telephony systems

## Advantages

- **Pay-as-you-go pricing** - You only pay for actual usage (meeting minutes, messages sent, etc.)
- **Scalable** - Built on AWS infrastructure, can handle small to very large meetings
- **Customizable** - You control the UX and can embed it into your existing applications
- **No meeting time limits** - Unlike consumer products with time restrictions

The SDK is particularly popular with developers who want communication features but need more control and customization than what's available with standalone products like Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
