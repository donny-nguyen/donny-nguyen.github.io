# Taxable Income

In the U.S., **taxable income** is subject to multiple layers of taxation, depending on your residency status, income level, and location. Here’s a breakdown of the **key taxes** that may apply:

---

### **1. Federal Income Tax**  
- **What it is**: A progressive tax on your worldwide income (if a **resident alien**) or U.S.-sourced income (if a **nonresident alien**).  
- **Tax Rates (2024)**:  
  - **10%–37%** (for individuals, based on income brackets).  
  - **Capital gains tax** (0%, 15%, or 20% for long-term investments).  
- **Forms**:  
  - Residents: **Form 1040**  
  - Nonresidents: **Form 1040-NR**

### **2. State Income Tax**  
- **What it is**: Tax imposed by your state of residence (or work, for nonresidents).  
- **Rates**: Vary by state (e.g., **0% in Texas/Florida**, up to **13.3% in California**).  
- **Who pays**:  
  - Residents: Taxed on **all income** (even from other states).  
  - Nonresidents: Taxed only on income **earned in that state**.

### **3. Local Income Tax**  
- **What it is**: Additional tax levied by some cities/counties (e.g., NYC, Philadelphia).

### **4. FICA Taxes (Social Security & Medicare)**  
- **What it is**: Payroll taxes funding federal benefits (see [previous answer](#what-are-social-security--medicare-taxes)).  
- **Who pays**:  
  - **Employees**: 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare).  
  - **Self-employed**: 15.3% (both halves).  
  - **Exemptions**: F-1/J-1 students (first 5 years).

### **5. Additional Taxes (For High Earners or Special Cases)**  
- **Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)**:  
  - **3.8%** on investment income (e.g., dividends, rental income) if AGI > **$200K (Single)/$250K (Married)**.  
- **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**:  
  - Ensures high-income taxpayers pay a minimum tax (26%–28% rates).
