# Iterator

In Java, an Iterator is an interface that provides a way to traverse or iterate over a collection of objects, such as lists, sets, or other data structures. It is part of the `java.util` package and allows us to access elements of a collection one by one.

Here are some key points about the `Iterator` interface:

### Basic Methods
   - `boolean hasNext()`: Returns `true` if there are more elements to iterate over, and `false` otherwise.
   - `E next()`: Returns the next element in the iteration.
   - `void remove()`: Removes the last element returned by the iterator from the underlying collection. This is an optional operation and may not be supported by all collections.

### Usage Example

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class IteratorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a collection
        ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
        fruits.add("Apple");
        fruits.add("Banana");
        fruits.add("Mango");

        // Get an Iterator
        Iterator<String> iterator = fruits.iterator();

        // Iterate over the collection
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            String fruit = iterator.next();
            System.out.println(fruit);

            // Optional remove operation
            if (fruit.equals("Banana")) {
                iterator.remove();
            }
        }

        // After removal
        System.out.println(fruits);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
   - `Iterator` allows the user to traverse the collection without exposing the underlying representation.
   - It provides a fail-safe mechanism to remove elements during iteration.

### Limitations
   - `Iterator` only moves forward and cannot be reset or move backward.
   - Removing an element using `remove()` can only be done once per call to `next()`. If called multiple times consecutively without a `next()`, it will throw `IllegalStateException`.

### Enhanced for-loop (for-each)
   While an `Iterator` is useful, Java provides an enhanced `for` loop (`for-each` loop) as a more convenient way to iterate through collections, although we can't modify the collection during iteration with this method.

```java
for (String fruit : fruits) {
    System.out.println(fruit);
}
```
