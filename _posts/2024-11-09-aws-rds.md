**What is AWS RDS?**

* **Managed Relational Database Service:**  AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
* **Simplified Management:** AWS RDS automates many of the routine database management tasks, such as provisioning, patching, backups, and failover. This frees us up to focus on our application development.

    * MySQL

    * Amazon Aurora (a fully managed relational database built for the cloud)
* **Enhanced Performance & Availability:** Features like Multi-AZ deployments with automatic failover and read replicas help ensure high availability and scalability.
