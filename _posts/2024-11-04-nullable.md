# Nullable

In Dart, a *nullable* variable is one that can hold a `null` value, meaning it might have no value at all. This concept is important in languages like Dart that enforce *null safety*, where variables must either explicitly allow nulls or be guaranteed to hold a non-null value.

### Declaring Nullable and Non-Nullable Variables
In Dart, all variables are non-nullable by default. This means that a variable cannot be null unless we explicitly mark it as nullable by adding a question mark `?` after its type. Here’s how it works:

```dart
int a;       // Non-nullable: cannot hold `null`
int? b;      // Nullable: can hold `null`
```

In this example:
- `a` is a non-nullable integer, so we have to assign a value before using it.
- `b` is a nullable integer, so it can hold either an integer value or `null`.

### Checking for Null
To safely access or manipulate a nullable variable, we need to check if it’s `null` before using it. Dart provides several ways to handle nullable variables:

1. **Using `if` statements**:
   ```dart
   int? b;
   if (b != null) {
     print(b + 5);  // Safe to use `b` here
   }
   ```

2. **Null-aware operators**:
   Dart includes several operators to work with nullable values efficiently:

   - **Null-aware assignment (`??=`)**:
     This assigns a value to a nullable variable only if it’s currently `null`.
     ```dart
     int? b;
     b ??= 10;   // Assigns 10 to `b` if `b` is null
     print(b);   // Output: 10
     ```

   - **Null-coalescing operator (`??`)**:
     This provides a fallback value if the variable is `null`.
     ```dart
     int? b;
     int result = b ?? 0;   // Uses 0 if `b` is null
     print(result);         // Output: 0
     ```

   - **Null-aware access (`?.`)**:
     This allows we to access a member of an object only if it isn’t `null`.
     ```dart
     String? name;
     print(name?.length);   // Safe; returns null if `name` is null
     ```

3. **Type promotion with `if`**:
   When we check a nullable variable with an `if` statement, Dart promotes it to a non-nullable type within that scope, meaning we don’t need extra syntax to use it safely.

   ```dart
   int? b;
   if (b != null) {
     print(b + 5);   // `b` is promoted to non-nullable here
   }
   ```

4. **The `late` keyword**:
   If we’re certain a variable will be initialized later but can’t assign a value immediately, we can use `late`:
   ```dart
   late int a;
   a = 10;
   print(a);   // Output: 10
   ```

### Example Usage
Here’s an example showing how nullable variables work in practice:

```dart
void printName(String? name) {
  // Providing a default name if `name` is null
  print("Hello, ${name ?? 'Guest'}!");
}

void main() {
  String? userName;
  printName(userName);   // Output: Hello, Guest!

  userName = "Alice";
  printName(userName);   // Output: Hello, Alice!
}
```

In this example, `name` is a nullable `String`, so it can hold `null`. When `null` is passed to `printName`, it defaults to "Guest". When a name is assigned, that name is used instead.

### Summary
- Use `?` after the type to declare a nullable variable.
- Use `??`, `??=`, and `?.` operators for safe null handling.
- Use type promotion in `if` statements to handle nullable variables.
- Use `late` for variables we guarantee will be initialized before use.

This null safety system in Dart helps reduce runtime errors by enforcing nullable and non-nullable distinctions at compile-time.
