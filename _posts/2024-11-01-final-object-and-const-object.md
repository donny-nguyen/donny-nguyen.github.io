**Final vs. Const Objects in Dart**

In Dart, `final` and `const` keywords are used to declare immutable objects, but they differ in their initialization time and level of immutability.

**Final Objects:**

* **Runtime Initialization:** A `final` object can be initialized at runtime, meaning its value can be determined dynamically.
* **Object-Level Immutability:** Once a `final` object is assigned, it cannot be reassigned to a different object. However, the object itself might still be mutable.

**Example:**

```dart
final List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[0] = 10; // This is allowed, modifying the first element
```

**Const Objects:**

* **Compile-Time Constants:** A `const` object must be initialized at compile time, meaning its value is known and fixed before the program runs.
* **Deep Immutability:** Both the object itself and its fields are immutable. This means we cannot modify any property of the object.

**Example:**

```dart
const List<String> colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// colors[0] = "yellow"; // This will result in a compile-time error
```

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Final Object | Const Object |
|---|---|---|
| Initialization Time | Runtime | Compile Time |
| Mutability of Object | Immutable | Immutable |
| Mutability of Object's Fields | Mutable | Immutable |
| Memory Allocation | Allocated at runtime | Allocated at compile time |

**When to Use Which:**

* **Final Object:**
  - When we need an object that is fixed once initialized but allows for modifications to its internal state.
  - When we want to initialize the object at runtime, for example, based on user input or data from an API.
* **Const Object:**
  - When we need an object that is completely immutable and its values are known at compile time.
  - For performance optimization, as `const` objects can be reused and optimized by the compiler.

By understanding these distinctions, we can effectively choose the appropriate keyword to create objects that meet our specific requirements in Dart.
