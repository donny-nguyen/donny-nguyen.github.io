# Types of Joins in SQL

In SQL, `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` are different types of joins used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column between them. Here's a breakdown of each type and their differences:

### 1. **INNER JOIN**:
- **Definition**: An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to retrieve rows that have common values in the columns specified.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM TableA
  INNER JOIN TableB
  ON TableA.common_column = TableB.common_column;
  ```

### 2. **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**):
- **Definition**: A `LEFT JOIN` returns all the rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the right table.
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to include all records from the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right table.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM TableA
  LEFT JOIN TableB
  ON TableA.common_column = TableB.common_column;
  ```

### 3. **RIGHT JOIN** (or **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**):
- **Definition**: A `RIGHT JOIN` returns all the rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the left table.
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to include all records from the right table regardless of whether there is a match in the left table.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM TableA
  RIGHT JOIN TableB
  ON TableA.common_column = TableB.common_column;
  ```

### Summary of Differences:
- **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves only the matching rows from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table (or `NULL` if no match).
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Retrieves all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table (or `NULL` if no match).

### Example Scenario:
Imagine two tables: `Employees` and `Departments`.

- **INNER JOIN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  INNER JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```
  This will return only employees who belong to a department listed in the `Departments` table.

- **LEFT JOIN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  LEFT JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```
  This will return all employees, including those who do not belong to any department (with `NULL` in `DepartmentName`).

- **RIGHT JOIN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  RIGHT JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```
  This will return all departments, including those with no employees assigned (with `NULL` in `Name`).

I hope this helps you understand the differences between these types of joins!
