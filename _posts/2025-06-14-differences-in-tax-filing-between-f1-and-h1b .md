# Differences in Tax Filing between F-1 OPT and H-1B

There are key differences in tax filing between **F-1 OPT** (a nonresident alien status) and **H-1B** (typically a resident alien status after meeting the **Substantial Presence Test**). Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Tax Residency Status**  
- **F-1 OPT (Nonresident Alien - NRA)**  
  - Generally treated as a **nonresident for tax purposes** for the first **5 calendar years** (exempt from the Substantial Presence Test under the "exempt individual" rule).  
  - After 5 years, may become a **resident alien** for tax purposes if meeting the Substantial Presence Test.  

- **H-1B (Resident Alien - RA)**  
  - Usually becomes a **resident alien for tax purposes** once they meet the **Substantial Presence Test** (physically present in the U.S. for at least **183 days** over 3 years, with a weighted calculation).  
  - Resident aliens are taxed on **worldwide income** (like U.S. citizens).

### **2. Tax Forms Used**  
- **F-1 OPT (Nonresident Alien)**  
  - Files **Form 1040-NR** (or **1040-NR-EZ** if eligible) for federal taxes.  
  - May need to file **Form 8843** (even if no income) to claim exempt status under the Substantial Presence Test.  
  - **Wages reported on Form W-2 (Box 1 and Box 16 for state wages).**  

- **H-1B (Resident Alien)**  
  - Files **Form 1040** (same as U.S. citizens).  
  - No need for Form 8843.  
  - **Wages reported on Form W-2 (Box 1, 2, and state wages in Box 16).**

### **3. Tax Treaties & Deductions**  
- **F-1 OPT (NRA)**  
  - May benefit from **tax treaties** (e.g., India-U.S. treaty allows exemption for scholarship income).  
  - **No standard deduction** (but may itemize deductions).  
  - **Social Security & Medicare (FICA) Taxes**:  
    - Exempt for the first **5 years** on F-1 status (but some employers mistakenly withhold—must request refund via **Form 843**).  

- **H-1B (RA)**  
  - Can claim the **standard deduction** ($13,850 for 2023, $14,600 for 2024).  
  - **No FICA tax exemption** (must pay Social Security & Medicare taxes).  
  - Tax treaties may still apply but are less common for H-1B workers.  

---

### **4. State Taxes**  
- Both F-1 OPT and H-1B filers must pay **state income tax** if their state has one (e.g., California, New York).  
- Some states (like **Texas, Florida**) have no income tax.  

---

### **5. Dual-Status Tax Year (Transition Year)**  
- If an F-1 student transitions to H-1B mid-year and meets the Substantial Presence Test, they may be a **dual-status alien** (part-year resident).  
  - **File both 1040-NR (for NRA period) and 1040 (for RA period).**  
  - Must prorate income and deductions.

### **What Should You Do?**  
- **F-1 OPT**: Ensure your employer does **not** withhold FICA taxes (if within 5 years).  
- **H-1B**: File as a resident, claim deductions, and report all global income.  
- **Dual-Status Year**: Seek a tax professional to avoid errors.
