# Lucid ORM

Lucid in Adonis.js is the official Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) built on top of Knex.js, designed to provide an active record-style data modeling and querying layer for SQL databases within Adonis.js applications.[^1][^2][^3]

### Core Features

- Lucid allows you to define models as JavaScript (or TypeScript) classes that map directly to your database tables. Each model extends a `BaseModel` and defines columns using decorators, supporting both direct data mapping and custom business logic.[^2][^1]
- CRUD operations are streamlined, letting you create, read, update, and delete database records using intuitive class-based methods rather than raw SQL queries.[^3][^2]
- Relationships between models (e.g., hasOne, hasMany, belongsToMany) are easily managed, providing convenient methods for traversing and querying related data.[^7][^3]
- Lifecycle hooks, serialization control, and custom methods/properties allow you to encapsulate domain logic cleanly within each model.[^3][^7]


### Supported Databases

- Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server out-of-the-box, letting you choose or migrate across major SQL databases easily.[^9]


### Example Model (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import { BaseModel, column } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'

export default class User extends BaseModel {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  declare id: number

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true })
  declare createdAt: DateTime

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true, autoUpdate: true })
  declare updatedAt: DateTime
}
```


### Usage and Customization

- Models are typically located in the `app/Models` directory.
- You can leverage Lucid for advanced features like eager loading, query scopes, and pagination, as well as transactional operations.[^7]
- Lucid integrates tightly with AdonisJS CLI tools for creating migrations, models, factories, and seeders to help manage and populate your database schema.[^9]


### Installation

To install Lucid in your AdonisJS project:

```
npm i @adonisjs/lucid
```

After installing, the setup process will help configure database connections and essential dependencies like Luxon for date handling.[^9]

Lucid ORM is an integral and powerful part of the Adonis.js ecosystem, focusing on developer productivity, maintainability, and a rich Active Record pattern for database management.[^2][^1][^3][^9]
