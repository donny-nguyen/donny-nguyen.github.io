## How to Seed Data in Adonis.js

**Database seeding** in Adonis.js allows you to populate your database with initial or sample data, which is especially useful for development and testing.

### Creating a Seeder

1. **Generate a seeder file** using the Ace CLI:
   ```
   node ace make:seeder User
   ```
   This will create a file in `database/seeders/`, e.g., `UserSeeder.ts`.

2. **Edit the seeder file** to define the data you want to insert. A typical seeder extends `BaseSeeder` and implements a `run` method:
   ```typescript
   import BaseSeeder from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Seeder'
   import User from 'App/Models/User'

   export default class UserSeeder extends BaseSeeder {
     public async run () {
       await User.create({
         email: 'example@adonisjs.com',
         password: 'secret',
       })
     }
   }
   ```
   You can also use methods like `updateOrCreateMany` to avoid duplicating records.

### Running Seeders

- **Run all seeders:**
  ```
  node ace db:seed
  ```
  This command executes the `run` method of every seeder in the `database/seeders` directory.

- **Run a specific seeder file:**
  ```
  node ace db:seed --files "./database/seeders/UserSeeder.ts"
  ```
  You can use the `--files` flag multiple times to specify more than one seeder.

- **Interactive mode:**
  ```
  node ace db:seed -i
  ```
  This lets you select which seeders to run interactively.

- **Specify a database connection:**
  ```
  node ace db:seed --connection=your_connection_name
  ```
  The connection is passed to the seeder and can be used for model operations.

### Additional Notes

- Seeders are typically used in development and testing environments.
- You can combine seeders with factories to generate large amounts of dummy data.
- Running seeders in production should be done with caution, and you may need to use the `--force` flag.

**Summary:**  
To seed data in Adonis.js, create a seeder file, define your data in the `run` method, and execute `node ace db:seed` to populate your database.
