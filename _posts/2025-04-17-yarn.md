# Yarn

Yarn is a **JavaScript package manager** developed by Facebook, and it's used to manage project dependencies. It was created as an alternative to **npm** (Node Package Manager), with a focus on speed, security, and consistency.

### ðŸ”§ What Yarn Does
Just like `npm`, Yarn helps you:
- Install packages (libraries/modules)
- Manage versioning of those packages
- Handle dependency resolution (which versions of a package should be used)
- Run scripts (like `yarn start`, `yarn build`, etc.)

### ðŸ†š Yarn vs npm
Hereâ€™s how Yarn stands out (especially when it was first introduced):
- **Faster installs**: Uses parallel operations and caching to speed things up.
- **Lockfile (`yarn.lock`)**: Ensures the exact same versions of dependencies are installed across every machine.
- **Offline installs**: Because of caching, Yarn can install packages even when you're offline.
- **Deterministic dependency resolution**: It always installs the same dependencies in the same way across every environment.

### ðŸ§ª Common Commands
| Action                   | Yarn Command         | npm Equivalent         |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initialize project       | yarn init            | npm init               |
| Add a package            | yarn add package     | npm install package    |
| Remove a package         | yarn remove package  | npm uninstall package  |
| Install all deps         | yarn                 | npm install            |
| Upgrade a package        | yarn upgrade         | npm update             |

### ðŸ“¦ Yarn 2+ (aka Berry)
Yarn introduced **Yarn 2** and later versions (codenamed *Berry*), which brought some big changes:
- **Plug'n'Play (PnP)**: A new approach to module resolution that eliminates `node_modules`
- **Workspaces improvements**: Better support for monorepos
- **Zero installs**: All dependencies can be committed to the repo

Yarn 2+ is a bit more opinionated, and not all projects are ready for it out of the box, so some teams still stick to Yarn 1.

If you're already using `npm`, you can usually switch to Yarn just by running:
```bash
npm install --global yarn
```
