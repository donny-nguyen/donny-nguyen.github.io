# Function Components vs Class Components

Function components have become more popular than class components in React for several reasons:

### 1. **Simplicity & Readability**
Function components are more concise and easier to read compared to class components. They require less boilerplate code, making development faster and reducing the chances of errors.

### 2. **Performance Improvements**
Function components generally perform better because they avoid unnecessary re-renders and memory overhead associated with class components. React optimizes function components more efficiently.

### 3. **React Hooks**
With the introduction of **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), function components gained the ability to manage state and lifecycle methods without needing a class. This made them more powerful and flexible.

### 4. **Better Reusability & Composition**
Function components encourage a more modular approach, making it easier to reuse and compose components. Hooks allow developers to extract logic into reusable functions, improving maintainability.

### 5. **Future-Proofing**
React's development is increasingly focused on function components and hooks. Many new features and optimizations are designed with function components in mind, making them the preferred choice for modern React applications.
