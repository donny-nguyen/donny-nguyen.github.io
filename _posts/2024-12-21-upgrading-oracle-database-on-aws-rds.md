# Upgrading an Oracle Database on AWS RDS

Upgrading an Oracle Database on AWS RDS involves several steps. Below is a detailed guide:

---

### **1. Pre-Upgrade Checklist**
1. **Review AWS Documentation**: Check the AWS RDS documentation for the specific steps and supported versions for the upgrade.
2. **Verify Compatibility**: Ensure that your target Oracle version is compatible with your existing version.
   - Check for any deprecated features or parameters in the new version.
3. **Backup Your Database**:
   - Create a manual snapshot of your database instance for rollback in case of an issue.
   - AWS automatically creates a backup before the upgrade, but having a manual backup ensures more control.
4. **Test the Upgrade**:
   - Use a test instance with a copy of your production database to simulate the upgrade process.
5. **Check Storage**:
   - Ensure there’s enough free storage for the upgrade process.
6. **Understand the Downtime**:
   - The upgrade involves downtime. Plan accordingly to minimize impact on your application.
