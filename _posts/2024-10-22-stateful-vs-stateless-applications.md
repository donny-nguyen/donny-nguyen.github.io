# Stateful vs. Stateless Applications

**Stateful applications** maintain a persistent state, remembering information about previous interactions or data. This state can be stored in memory, databases, or other storage mechanisms. Examples include:

* **Shopping carts:** The application keeps track of items added by the user.
* **Login systems:** The application remembers the user's login credentials.
* **Game servers:** The application maintains the state of the game world and players.

**Stateless applications** do not maintain any state. Each request is treated as a self-contained unit, with no reference to previous requests. This makes them simpler to design, scale, and maintain. Examples include:

* **Web servers:** Each request is handled independently, without any knowledge of previous requests.
* **API services:** Each request is processed based on the data provided in the request itself.
* **Load balancers:** Requests are distributed across multiple servers without any state information.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Stateful Application | Stateless Application |
|---|---|---|
| State Persistence | Maintains state | Does not maintain state |
| Complexity | More complex to design and manage | Simpler to design and manage |
| Scalability | Can be challenging to scale horizontally | Easier to scale horizontally |
| Reliability | Can be more vulnerable to failures | More resilient to failures |

### When to Use Which?

* **Stateful applications** are suitable for applications that require persistent state, such as those involving user interactions, data storage, or real-time updates.
* **Stateless applications** are suitable for applications that do not require state, such as API services, web servers, and load balancers.

**In many cases, a combination of stateful and stateless components is used to create a more robust and scalable architecture.** For example, a web application might use a stateless web server to handle incoming requests and a stateful database to store user data.
