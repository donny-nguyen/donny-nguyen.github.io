# Spring Framework

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful and versatile framework for building Java applications. Here are some key points about it:

- **Core Features**: It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, allowing you to focus on your application's business logic rather than the underlying infrastructure.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Spring uses IoC to manage the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, which helps in creating loosely coupled applicationsÂ¹.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: This feature allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, and transaction management) from your business logic.
- **Spring MVC**: It includes a robust model-view-controller (MVC) framework for building web applications.
- **Data Access**: Spring simplifies data access using JDBC, ORM frameworks like Hibernate, and transaction management.
- **Modularity**: You can use the entire framework or just the parts that you need, making it highly modular and flexible.
