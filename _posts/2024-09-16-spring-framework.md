# Spring Framework

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful and versatile framework for building Java applications. Here are some key points about it:

- **Core Features**: It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, allowing us to focus on our application's business logic rather than the underlying infrastructure.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Spring uses IoC to manage the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, which helps in creating loosely coupled applications.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: This feature allows us to separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, and transaction management) from our business logic.
- **[Spring MVC](https://donny-nguyen.github.io/2024/09/20/spring-mvc.html)**: It includes a robust model-view-controller (MVC) framework for building web applications.
- **Data Access**: Spring simplifies data access using JDBC, ORM frameworks like Hibernate, and transaction management.
- **Modularity**: We can use the entire framework or just the parts that we need, making it highly modular and flexible.
