# Pyenv

Pyenv is a powerful tool for managing multiple versions of Python on a single system. It‚Äôs especially useful for developers who work on projects that require different Python versions or want to avoid conflicts with the system-installed Python.

### üß∞ What Pyenv Does
- **Version Switching**: Easily switch between Python versions (e.g., 3.8, 3.10, 2.7) for different projects.
- **Local vs Global Versions**: Set a global default Python version or override it per project using `.python-version` files.
- **Installation Management**: Install multiple Python versions side-by-side without interfering with your system Python.
- **Plugin Support**: Extend functionality with plugins like `pyenv-virtualenv` for managing virtual environments.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Pyenv works by shimming the `python` command. It inserts a directory of shims into your `PATH`, and those shims redirect to the appropriate Python version based on your configuration.

### üõ†Ô∏è Typical Use Cases
- Testing code across multiple Python versions.
- Avoiding dependency conflicts between projects.
- Keeping your system Python untouched while using newer versions for development.

If you're working with Python regularly‚Äîespecially in backend development like you are‚ÄîPyenv is a great way to keep your environment clean and flexible.
