# Qualifier

In the **Spring Framework**, `@Qualifier` is an annotation used in the context of **Dependency Injection (DI)** to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present in the Spring application context. When Spring encounters multiple beans of the same type and needs to autowire one of them, it doesn't know which one to choose by default. The `@Qualifier` annotation helps specify exactly which bean should be injected.

### When to Use `@Qualifier`

- **Multiple Bean Instances**: When we have more than one bean of the same type (e.g., multiple implementations of an interface), Spring needs guidance on which bean to inject.
- **Disambiguation**: It disambiguates which bean should be used when autowiring by providing a specific identifier or name.

### How `@Qualifier` Works

`@Qualifier` works alongside the `@Autowired` annotation (or other injection annotations like `@Inject`) to specify which bean should be injected. Here's how we can use it:

1. **Define Multiple Beans**: Suppose we have an interface `Vehicle` with two implementations: `Car` and `Bike`.

    ```java
    public interface Vehicle {
        void move();
    }

    @Component
    @Qualifier("car")
    public class Car implements Vehicle {
        @Override
        public void move() {
            System.out.println("Car is moving");
        }
    }

    @Component
    @Qualifier("bike")
    public class Bike implements Vehicle {
        @Override
        public void move() {
            System.out.println("Bike is moving");
        }
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, we can use the `@Component("car")` and `@Component("bike")` annotations to assign specific bean names.

2. **Inject the Desired Bean**: Use `@Autowired` along with `@Qualifier` to inject the specific bean we need.

    ```java
    @Component
    public class VehicleService {

        private final Vehicle vehicle;

        @Autowired
        public VehicleService(@Qualifier("car") Vehicle vehicle) {
            this.vehicle = vehicle;
        }

        public void startJourney() {
            vehicle.move();
        }
    }
    ```

    In this example, `VehicleService` will be injected with the `Car` bean instead of `Bike`.

### Alternative Usage: Field Injection

While constructor injection is recommended for better testability and immutability, `@Qualifier` can also be used with field injection:

```java
@Component
public class VehicleService {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("bike")
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public void startJourney() {
        vehicle.move();
    }
}
```

### Combining with `@Primary`

Spring also provides the `@Primary` annotation, which can be used to designate a default bean when multiple candidates are present. If one bean is marked as `@Primary`, it will be chosen by default unless another bean is explicitly specified with `@Qualifier`.

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}

@Component
public class Bike implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Bike is moving");
    }
}
```

In this case, `Car` will be injected by default unless a different bean is specified using `@Qualifier`.

### Benefits of Using `@Qualifier`

- **Clarity**: Makes it explicit which bean should be injected, enhancing code readability.
- **Flexibility**: Allows multiple implementations of the same interface to coexist and be injected as needed.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates easier refactoring and scaling of applications by clearly defining dependencies.

### Best Practices

1. **Prefer Constructor Injection**: Itâ€™s generally recommended to use constructor injection over field injection for better testability and immutability.

2. **Use Descriptive Qualifiers**: When naming qualifiers, use clear and descriptive names that convey the purpose or type of the bean.

3. **Combine with Profiles**: `@Qualifier` can be used alongside Spring Profiles to inject different beans based on the active profile.

4. **Limit Bean Ambiguity**: While `@Qualifier` helps resolve ambiguities, strive to design our application in a way that minimizes the need for multiple beans of the same type unless necessary.

### Example Scenario

Imagine we are building an application that sends notifications through different channels, such as email and SMS. We might have an interface `NotificationService` with two implementations: `EmailNotificationService` and `SmsNotificationService`.

```java
public interface NotificationService {
    void sendNotification(String message);
}

@Component
@Qualifier("email")
public class EmailNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        // Send email
    }
}

@Component
@Qualifier("sms")
public class SmsNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        // Send SMS
    }
}
```

In our service that needs to send notifications, we can specify which `NotificationService` to inject:

```java
@Service
public class NotificationManager {

    private final NotificationService notificationService;

    @Autowired
    public NotificationManager(@Qualifier("email") NotificationService notificationService) {
        this.notificationService = notificationService;
    }

    public void notifyUser(String message) {
        notificationService.sendNotification(message);
    }
}
```

If we later decide to switch to SMS notifications, we can simply change the qualifier:

```java
@Autowired
public NotificationManager(@Qualifier("sms") NotificationService notificationService) {
    this.notificationService = notificationService;
}
```

### Conclusion

The `@Qualifier` annotation in Spring Framework is a powerful tool for managing dependencies when multiple beans of the same type exist. By explicitly specifying which bean to inject, `@Qualifier` helps maintain clear and maintainable code, especially in large and complex applications with numerous components and services.
