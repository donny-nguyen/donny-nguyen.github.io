# Multi-Party Video Conferencing with Adonis.js and AWS

When building a multi-party video conferencing application with Adonis.js, leveraging AWS services can provide a robust and scalable solution. Below are the recommended approaches and architectures.

## **AWS Chime SDK** (Recommended)

This is AWS's purpose-built solution for real-time communication and is specifically designed for conferencing applications.

### Key Features

**Video Conferencing Capabilities:**
- Multi-party audio and video (up to 250 participants with video)
- Screen sharing
- Built-in audio/video processing
- Automatic bandwidth adaptation
- Active speaker detection
- Video tile management

**What AWS Chime SDK Provides:**
- WebRTC infrastructure (fully managed)
- Global media servers (no need to manage SFUs)
- TURN/STUN servers included
- Recording capabilities
- Live transcription
- Background blur/replacement
- Echo cancellation and noise suppression

**Pricing Model:**
- Pay-per-use (per minute per attendee)
- No upfront costs or minimum fees
- Separate pricing for audio, video, and features

### Integration with Adonis.js

```javascript
// Perfect Architecture
Frontend: React/Vue with Chime SDK JS
Backend: Adonis.js
AWS Services:
- Chime SDK: Video/audio conferencing
- RDS/PostgreSQL: User and meeting data
- S3: Recording storage
- Lambda: Optional serverless functions
- API Gateway: Optional REST endpoints
```

### Adonis.js Integration Flow

```javascript
// 1. Adonis.js creates meeting via AWS SDK
import Chime from '@aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-meetings'

// In your Adonis controller
async createMeeting({ request, response }) {
  const chime = new ChimeSDKMeetingsClient({ region: 'us-east-1' })
  
  const meeting = await chime.createMeeting({
    ExternalMeetingId: 'unique-meeting-id',
    MediaRegion: 'us-east-1'
  })
  
  return response.json(meeting)
}

// 2. Create attendee
async joinMeeting({ request, response }) {
  const attendee = await chime.createAttendee({
    MeetingId: meetingId,
    ExternalUserId: userId
  })
  
  return response.json(attendee)
}

// 3. Frontend uses Chime SDK JS to connect
```

## Alternative: **AWS IVS Real-Time Streaming**

AWS recently introduced **IVS Real-Time** for low-latency multi-party streaming:

**Use Case:**
- Better for broadcast-style interactions (gaming streams with guests, panels)
- Sub-500ms latency
- Up to 12 participants on stage

**Limitations vs Chime:**
- Fewer participants can actively stream
- Less feature-rich than Chime SDK for conferencing
- Better for streaming scenarios than meetings

## Comparison

| Feature | AWS Chime SDK | AWS IVS Real-Time |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Use Case | Video conferencing | Interactive streaming |
| Max Active Video | 250 | 12 on stage |
| Screen Sharing | ✅ Yes | Limited |
| Recording | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in |
| Transcription | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Background Effects | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Best For | Zoom-like apps | Twitch-like apps |

## Recommended Architecture with Adonis.js + AWS Chime SDK

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │
│  (React + SDK)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │ Adonis  │ ← Create meetings, manage users
    │   API   │ ← Authentication & authorization
    └────┬────┘ ← Store meeting metadata
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────┐
    │  AWS Chime SDK   │ ← Handles all WebRTC
    │  (Managed SFU)   │ ← Media routing
    └──────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- No need to manage WebRTC servers
- Global infrastructure (low latency worldwide)
- Scales automatically
- Focus on your application logic in Adonis.js
- AWS handles the complex media routing

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install AWS SDK
npm install @aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-meetings
