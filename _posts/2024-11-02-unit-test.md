# Unit Test

A **unit test** in Java is a method used to test individual components (or "units") of code to verify that they work as expected. The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and test that it functions correctly in isolation. Typically, unit tests focus on the smallest testable parts of an application, such as methods or classes, to ensure they perform as intended.

### Key Aspects of Unit Testing in Java:

1. **Isolation of Code**: Unit tests are designed to be independent of other parts of the system. This allows us to test only one "unit" without relying on external dependencies (like databases, networks, or file systems). This is often achieved by using mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito).

2. **Testing Frameworks**: Java provides several libraries for creating unit tests, the most common being **JUnit**. Other popular libraries include TestNG and Spock. These frameworks help in setting up test cases, running them, and reporting results.

3. **Assertions**: In unit tests, assertions are used to verify the behavior of the code. For example, we may check if a method returns the correct value or if an exception is thrown when expected. JUnit provides `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertNotNull`, etc., to verify conditions.

4. **Repeatability**: Unit tests should produce the same results each time they run. They should not depend on external factors that could change, which helps maintain consistency in test results.

### Example of a Simple Unit Test in Java (using JUnit)

Suppose we have a class `Calculator` with a method `add(int a, int b)`:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

To test this `add` method, we might write a unit test like this:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.add(2, 3);
        assertEquals(5, result); // Expected outcome is 5
    }
}
```

In this example:

- **`@Test` annotation**: Marks the method as a test case that JUnit will run.
- **`assertEquals`**: Verifies that the actual result matches the expected result.

### Benefits of Unit Testing

- **Catch bugs early**: Detect issues at the smallest scale before they reach higher levels of code integration.
- **Facilitates code refactoring**: With tests in place, we can change code with confidence, knowing that tests will catch any introduced errors.
- **Improves code quality**: Writing unit tests encourages modular code and clear interfaces, enhancing maintainability.
