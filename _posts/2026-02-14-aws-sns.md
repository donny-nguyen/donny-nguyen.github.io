# Amazon Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS) 

**Amazon Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS)** is a **fully managed**, highly scalable **pub/sub messaging service** from AWS. It enables applications to send messages (notifications) instantly to multiple recipients or systems in a decoupled way.

It supports both:
- **Application-to-Application (A2A)** messaging → fan-out messages to other services/systems
- **Application-to-Person (A2P)** messaging → direct notifications to end users

### Core Concept: Topics + Publish/Subscribe Model

1. You create a **topic** (a logical communication channel).
2. **Publishers** send messages to that topic (one publish → many deliveries).
3. **Subscribers** register interest in the topic by subscribing their endpoints.
4. When a message is published, SNS automatically pushes (fan-out) copies to all valid subscribers.

This pattern is ideal for decoupling producers from consumers.

### Supported Subscription Protocols / Endpoint Types

- **Amazon SQS** queues (very common pairing)
- **AWS Lambda** functions
- **HTTP/HTTPS** endpoints (webhooks)
- **Email** (plain or with JSON format)
- **SMS** text messages
- **Mobile push notifications** (Apple APNs, Google FCM, Amazon ADM)
- **Platform applications** (for mobile push)

### Two Types of Topics (2025–2026 era)

| Feature              | Standard Topics                  | FIFO Topics                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Ordering             | Best-effort (usually preserved)  | Strictly first-in-first-out          |
| Exactly-once delivery| At-least-once (possible duplicates) | Exactly-once (with deduplication)   |
| Throughput           | Virtually unlimited              | Lower (but still high – ~300 msg/s)  |
| Use case             | Most applications, alerts, fan-out | Order-sensitive workflows, transactions |
| Message group ID     | Not required                     | Required for ordering & deduplication|

### Key Features

- **Message filtering** (subscribers can set filter policies to receive only relevant messages)
- **Message archiving & replay** (replay messages from the last 1–7 days)
- **Server-side encryption** (at rest with AWS KMS)
- **Delivery status logging** (to CloudWatch Logs)
- **Dead-letter queues** support
- **Message attributes** (key-value metadata)
- **Large message payloads** → use SNS Extended Client Library + S3 (up to ~2 GB)
- **Message data protection** (scanning for sensitive data patterns)

### Common Use Cases

- Real-time alerts & monitoring (CloudWatch alarms → SNS → email/SMS/Slack/Lambda)
- Fan-out in microservices / event-driven architectures
- Mobile & web push notifications
- SMS/email marketing / transactional messages
- Triggering serverless workflows (SNS → Lambda)
- Cross-account / cross-region notifications
- IoT device notifications

### Pricing (Pay-as-you-go, no upfront fees)

AWS offers a generous **free tier**:

- 1 million publish requests / month
- 1 million mobile push notifications / month
- 1,000 email notifications / month
- 100 SMS messages / month (account-level)

Beyond free tier (very approximate US pricing in 2025–2026):

- **Publishes** → ~$0.50 per million requests (each 64 KB chunk = 1 request)
- **Deliveries**:
  - HTTP/S → ~$0.60 per million
  - Lambda → often free (billed via Lambda)
  - SQS → often free (billed via SQS)
  - Email → ~$2.00 per 100,000
  - SMS → varies significantly by country (~$0.006–$0.045 per message)
  - Mobile push → ~$0.50 per million

FIFO topics are slightly more expensive than Standard.

### SNS vs Similar AWS Services (Quick Comparison)

| Service     | Best for                              | Delivery style     | Ordering guarantee | Typical pairing          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **SNS**     | Fan-out, notifications, push          | Push (immediate)   | Best-effort / FIFO | SNS → Lambda / SQS       |
| **SQS**     | Message queue, decoupling, buffering  | Pull               | Best-effort / FIFO | SNS → SQS (fan-out queue)|
| **EventBridge** | Event bus, SaaS integrations, schema | Push + advanced routing | Varies            | Complex event routing    |

In short: **SNS** is the "push fan-out" service — great whenever you want to broadcast one message to many destinations quickly.

If you're just starting, the AWS console makes creating a topic and subscribing an email or Lambda function very straightforward — you can test it end-to-end in under 5 minutes.
