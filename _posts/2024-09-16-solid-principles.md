# SOLID Principles

Those are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin), also known as Uncle Bob. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means we should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Essentially, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

These principles aim to make our code more robust and easier to manage.
