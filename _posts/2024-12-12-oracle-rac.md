# Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)

Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) is a database clustering technology that allows multiple instances of Oracle Database to run on separate servers while accessing a shared database. This setup provides **high availability**, **scalability**, and **load balancing** by distributing the workload across multiple servers.

### Key Features of Oracle RAC:
- **High Availability**: Oracle RAC ensures that the database remains available even if one or more instances fail. This is achieved through features like **Fast Application Notification (FAN)** and **Cache Fusion**.
- **Scalability**: Oracle RAC allows the database to scale out by adding more servers to the cluster, which can handle more transactions and users.
- **Load Balancing**: Workloads are distributed across multiple instances, improving performance and resource utilization.
- **Single System Image**: From the perspective of applications and users, the cluster appears as a single system, even though it is composed of multiple interconnected servers.

### How Oracle RAC Works:
- **Interconnect**: All instances in an Oracle RAC environment are connected through a high-speed interconnect, which allows them to share data and coordinate operations.
- **Cache Fusion**: This technology allows instances to share a single, global cache, ensuring data consistency and reducing the need for disk I/O.
- **Oracle Clusterware**: This infrastructure component manages the cluster, including resources like VIP addresses, databases, listeners, and services.

Oracle RAC is particularly useful for applications that require high availability and scalability, such as **e-commerce websites**, **financial systems**, and **telecommunication systems**.
