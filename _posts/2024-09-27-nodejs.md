# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable network applications.

Here are some key features of Node.js:

* **Event-driven architecture:** Node.js uses an event-driven model, which means it doesn't wait for a task to complete before moving on to the next one. This makes it highly efficient for handling many concurrent requests.
* **Non-blocking I/O:** Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, which means it doesn't wait for I/O operations to complete before continuing execution. This makes it possible for Node.js to handle many concurrent requests without blocking.
* **Single-threaded:** Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it only has one thread of execution. However, it uses a pool of threads to handle I/O operations. This makes it possible for Node.js to handle many concurrent requests without blocking.
* **Cross-platform:** Node.js can be run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Large ecosystem:** Node.js has a large ecosystem of modules and packages that can be used to build applications.

Node.js is commonly used for building web applications, network applications, and real-time applications. It is also a popular choice for building APIs and microservices.
