# When Should Not Use Circuit Breaker Pattern

The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is a fault-tolerance pattern that prevents a service or system from making repeated requests to a failing component. However, it should not be used in scenarios where the cost of a failed request is negligible, or the failure can be retried immediately without significant consequences. 

### Scenarios Where the Circuit Breaker Pattern Should Not Be Used
1. **Idempotent Operations with Negligible Costs**  
   If the operation is lightweight, idempotent, and has negligible resource cost, retrying it immediately may not require a circuit breaker.  
   Example: Fetching static configuration data from a resilient and fast cache service like Redis.

2. **Critical Operations That Must Always Try to Execute**  
   If the operation must always attempt execution regardless of failures (e.g., logging or metrics collection), using a circuit breaker could block necessary functionality.

3. **Intermittent Failures With Immediate Recovery**
   If failures are known to be temporary and retrying quickly can resolve the issue, a retry mechanism without a circuit breaker might be more appropriate.

### Example
#### A Scenario Where Circuit Breaker Should Not Be Used: Fetching Static Data
Suppose a service needs to fetch a list of configuration settings from a cache (e.g., Redis) on startup.

#### Without Circuit Breaker
```java
public List<String> fetchConfigurations() {
    try {
        return redisClient.get("configurations"); // Lightweight and fast
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Retrying...");
        return redisClient.get("configurations"); // Retry immediately
    }
}
```

This approach works because fetching configuration data:
- Is lightweight.
- Does not overload the system even if retried multiple times.
- Can handle intermittent failures quickly (e.g., Redis temporarily unavailable).

#### With Circuit Breaker
Using a circuit breaker here might block all configuration fetching if the cache becomes temporarily unavailable, leading to unnecessary delays.

```java
public List<String> fetchConfigurations() {
    CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker.ofDefaults("fetchConfigBreaker");

    Supplier<List<String>> fetchSupplier = CircuitBreaker.decorateSupplier(circuitBreaker, 
        () -> redisClient.get("configurations"));

    try {
        return fetchSupplier.get();
    } catch (CallNotPermittedException e) {
        System.out.println("Circuit is open, cannot fetch configurations.");
        return Collections.emptyList(); // Return default or fallback
    }
}
```

#### Why Circuit Breaker is Not Ideal Here
- Configuration fetching is not resource-intensive.
- Fallback (empty configuration) might disrupt the service unnecessarily.
- Redis downtime is often short-lived, and retries can resolve it quickly.

In contrast, the **circuit breaker pattern is better suited** for protecting systems from expensive, long-lasting failures, such as calling an external payment gateway or an unreliable third-party API.
