# What Is the Standard Deduction?

The **standard deduction** is a fixed dollar amount that reduces your taxable income, lowering the amount of income you pay taxes on. It’s an alternative to **itemizing deductions** (like mortgage interest, medical expenses, or charitable donations).

### **Who Can Claim It?**  
- **U.S. residents** (citizens, green card holders, and H-1B visa holders meeting the **Substantial Presence Test**).  
- **Nonresident aliens (e.g., F-1 students in first 5 years)** **cannot** claim the standard deduction (must itemize or take $0).

### **Standard Deduction vs. Itemizing**  
- **Take the standard deduction** if it’s higher than your total itemized deductions.  
- **Itemize deductions** (Schedule A) if your eligible expenses (e.g., mortgage interest, medical bills >7.5% of income, large charitable donations) exceed the standard deduction.  

**Example**:  
- If you’re **Single** in 2024, your standard deduction is **$14,600**.  
- If your itemized deductions (e.g., $10K mortgage interest + $3K donations) total **$13K**, you’d **take the standard deduction** instead (since $14,600 > $13K).

### **Special Cases**  
1. **Dependents**:  
   - If someone can claim you as a dependent (e.g., F-1 students with parents filing for them), your standard deduction is limited to the **greater of**:  
     - $1,250 (2024), **or**  
     - Your earned income + $400 (up to the normal standard deduction).  

2. **Seniors/Blind**:  
   - Extra standard deduction for those **65+ or blind** ($1,550+ for Single, $1,250+ for Married in 2024).

### **Why It Matters**  
- Reduces your **taxable income**, lowering your tax bill.  
- Simplifies filing (no need to track receipts for itemizing).  

**Tax Tip**: Most Americans take the standard deduction because it’s larger than their itemized expenses.
