# Late

In Dart, the `late` keyword is used to declare a non-nullable variable that will be initialized later, typically when the initial value isn't available at the time of declaration. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to defer the initialization until the first time the variable is accessed or set. Here’s a closer look at its uses:

### 1. **Lazy Initialization**
   When a `late` variable is declared, its initialization is deferred until it’s accessed. This is useful when the initialization is resource-intensive or depends on conditions that aren't met at declaration time.

   ```dart
   late String description;

   void setDescription() {
     description = "This description was set later.";
   }
   ```

   Here, `description` is initialized only when `setDescription` is called.

### 2. **Non-nullable Variables with Late Assignment**
   In Dart, non-nullable variables must be initialized when they’re declared. By using `late`, we tell the compiler that we'll initialize the variable later, allowing us to use a non-nullable type without immediately assigning a value.

   ```dart
   late int count;
   count = 42;  // Can assign later, but must be assigned before use.
   ```

### 3. **Avoiding `null` Checks**
   `late` helps us avoid null checks for variables that we know will be initialized before use, but where the timing of initialization is deferred.

### 4. **Error on Access Before Initialization**
   If we try to access a `late` variable before it’s been assigned, Dart throws a runtime error. This ensures that we don’t accidentally access an uninitialized variable.

### Example of Runtime Error:
   ```dart
   late int age;
   print(age);  // Throws error: LateInitializationError: Field 'age' has not been initialized.
   ```

### 5. **Late with Final Variables**
   We can also use `late` with `final` variables to make them lazily initialized, ensuring they can be set only once. This is useful when creating constants that require some computation.

   ```dart
   late final String config = fetchConfig(); // Initialized only once, when accessed.
   ```

In summary, the `late` keyword in Dart is primarily used for deferring initialization and improving control over when a variable is set, while still ensuring it's non-null and avoiding unnecessary null checks.
