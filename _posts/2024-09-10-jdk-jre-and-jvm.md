![Java Conceptual Diagram](https://github.com/donny-nguyen/donny-nguyen.github.io/blob/main/images/java-conceptual-diagram.png)

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

**What it is:** The JDK is a software development kit that provides the tools and libraries needed to develop Java applications.

**What it includes:**
  * **javac:** The Java compiler that translates .java source code into bytecode, an intermediate language.
  * **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** A subset of the JDK that includes essential components to run Java programs.
  * **Other tools:** Debuggers, documentation generators, and classpath management utilities.

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

**What it is:** The JRE is a software environment that allows your computer to execute Java programs.

**What it includes:**

  * **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** The core component that interprets and executes bytecode instructions.
  * **Standard libraries:** Classes that provide functionalities for common tasks like file I/O, networking, and GUI development.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

**What it is:** The JVM is a software program that acts as a virtual machine.

**What it does:**

  * Takes bytecode generated by the javac compiler as input.

  * Translates the bytecode into machine code specific to your computer's processor at runtime (just-in-time compilation).
Executes the machine code instructions, allowing the Java program to run.
