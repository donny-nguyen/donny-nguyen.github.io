# Map.entry()

In Java, `Map.entry()` is a static method introduced in Java 9 as part of the `Map` interface. Its purpose is to create an immutable `Map.Entry` object, which represents a key-value pair. This method is useful for creating single entries without needing to create an entire `Map` instance.

### Key Points:
1. **Immutable Entry**: The `Map.Entry` created by `Map.entry()` is immutable, meaning its key and value cannot be modified after creation.
2. **Convenience**: It provides a concise way to create key-value pairs, especially when working with collections or streams.
3. **Utility**: It is often used in conjunction with methods like `Map.of()` or `Map.ofEntries()` to create small, immutable maps.

### Syntax:
```java
static <K, V> Map.Entry<K, V> entry(K key, V value)
```

### Example Usage:
```java
import java.util.Map;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an immutable Map.Entry
        Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry = Map.entry("key", 123);

        // Access the key and value
        System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey());   // Output: Key: key
        System.out.println("Value: " + entry.getValue()); // Output: Value: 123

        // Use with Map.ofEntries to create a map
        Map<String, Integer> map = Map.ofEntries(
            Map.entry("one", 1),
            Map.entry("two", 2),
            Map.entry("three", 3)
        );

        System.out.println(map); // Output: {one=1, two=2, three=3}
    }
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **Creating Small Maps**: When you need to create a small, fixed-size map with a few key-value pairs.
- **Stream Operations**: When working with streams and needing to create key-value pairs dynamically.
- **Testing**: For creating test data or mock entries in unit tests.

### Limitations:
- The `Map.Entry` created by `Map.entry()` is immutable, so you cannot modify its key or value after creation.
- It is not intended for creating large maps, as it is more suited for small, fixed-size collections.

In summary, `Map.entry()` is a utility method that simplifies the creation of immutable key-value pairs, making it easier to work with maps and collections in Java.
