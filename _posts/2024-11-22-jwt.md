# JSON Web Token (JWT)

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe method for representing claims securely between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications and APIs.

### **Structure of JWT**
A JWT consists of three parts:
1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type (`JWT`) and the hashing algorithm used (`HS256`, `RS256`, etc.).
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "HS256",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```

2. **Payload**: Contains the claims or data we want to transmit. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "1234567890",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "iat": 1516239022
   }
   ```
   Common types of claims:
   - **Registered Claims**: Predefined keys such as `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), and `aud` (audience).
   - **Public Claims**: Custom keys shared between parties.
   - **Private Claims**: Custom keys specific to an application.

3. **Signature**: Ensures the token is not tampered with. It is created by hashing the encoded header and payload using a secret or private key:
   ```
   HMACSHA256(
     base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
     secret
   )
   ```

The three parts are separated by dots, resulting in a token like this:
```

```

### **How JWT Works**
1. **Authentication**: 
   - The server generates a JWT upon successful user authentication and sends it to the client.
   - The client stores the token (e.g., in local storage or cookies).

2. **Authorization**:
   - For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT (often in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`).
   - The server verifies the token's signature and extracts claims to authorize the request.

### **Advantages**
- **Compact**: Suitable for URLs, cookies, and headers.
- **Self-contained**: Contains all necessary information for validation.
- **Stateless**: Server doesn't need to maintain session state.

### **Use Cases**
- Authentication (e.g., Single Sign-On, API authentication).
- Information exchange where tamper-proof and verifiable data is needed.

### **Limitations**
- **Cannot be revoked**: Unless stored in a revocation list or using short-lived tokens with refresh tokens.
- **Payload is visible**: Though it's signed, the data is not encrypted and can be decoded by anyone.

For secure implementation, it's crucial to:
- Use HTTPS to prevent token interception.
- Use strong secrets/keys for signing.
- Set expiration times (`exp`) and validate them.
