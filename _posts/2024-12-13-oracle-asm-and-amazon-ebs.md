# Oracle ASM and Amazon EBS

When setting up **Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, both **Oracle ASM (Automatic Storage Management)** and **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)** play crucial roles:

### Oracle ASM:
- **Storage Management**: Oracle ASM simplifies storage management by automating tasks such as disk provisioning, striping, and mirroring. It provides a centralized storage management solution for Oracle databases, including RAC.
- **High Availability**: ASM supports high availability features by enabling automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.
- **Performance**: ASM optimizes performance by distributing I/O load across multiple disks and dynamically rebalancing storage as needed.

### Amazon EBS:
- **Persistent Storage**: Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. These volumes persist independently of the life of the instance, making them ideal for database storage.
- **Multi-AZ Support**: EBS volumes can be replicated across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), providing high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Performance**: EBS offers different types of storage volumes (e.g., General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD) that cater to various performance needs. For Oracle RAC, using EBS volumes with Multi-Attach feature allows multiple EC2 instances to access the same EBS volume simultaneously.

### Combined Role in Oracle RAC on AWS:
- **Shared Storage**: Oracle ASM manages the shared storage for Oracle RAC, while Amazon EBS provides the underlying block storage volumes.
- **High Availability and Scalability**: The combination of Oracle ASM and Amazon EBS ensures high availability, scalability, and efficient storage management for Oracle RAC deployments on AWS.
