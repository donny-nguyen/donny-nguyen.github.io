**Express.js** is a minimal and flexible web application framework for **Node.js** that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating a server-side application with JavaScript by offering powerful tools for handling routing, middleware, HTTP requests, and more.

### Key Features of Express.js:
1. **Routing**: Express makes it easy to define routes to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
2. **Middleware**: Middleware functions in Express help handle requests and responses, allowing for tasks like request parsing, authentication, error handling, and more.
3. **Templating Engines**: Express can easily integrate with various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars to generate dynamic HTML content.
4. **Simple to Use**: With a few lines of code, we can create a server and handle HTTP requests.
5. **Flexible and Extensible**: Its modular structure allows us to add only the functionality we need, and we can extend it with various third-party libraries.
6. **Error Handling**: It offers built-in support for handling errors and improving application stability.

### Common Use Cases:
- Building APIs and RESTful services.
- Serving static files (like images, HTML, CSS).
- Handling form submissions.
- Integrating databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to create full-stack applications.

Express is one of the most widely used frameworks in Node.js development due to its ease of use and scalability.
